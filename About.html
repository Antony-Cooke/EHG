                    <h4>On 14th May 1940, the Minister of War, Anthony Eden, broadcast a national message asking for
                        volunteers.
                        <br><br><i>"We want large numbers of men in Great Britain who are British Subjects between the
                            ages of 17 and 65 to come forward now and offer their service in order to make assurance
                            doubly sure. The name of the new force which is now to be raised will be the Local Defence
                            Volunteers"</i>
                        <br><br>On 23rd June, 1940, Winston Churchill changed the name of the Local Defence Volunteers
                        to
                        "The Home Guard".
                        <br><br>The Home Guard was formed when there was a real risk of invasion; the intention was to
                        delay
                        an enemy invasion for as long as possible to give the Government time to form a front line from
                        which the enemy invasion could be repelled.
                        <br><br>The Government was expecting 150,000 men to volunteer for the Home Guard. Within the
                        first month, 750,000 men had done so, and by the end of June, 1940, the total number of
                        was over one million. The number of men in the Home Guard did not fall below one
                        million until they were stood down in December 1944.
                        <br><br>They trained in the evening in such things as weapons handling, unarmed combat and basic
                        saboutage. Local Home Guard commanders initially received little guidance from the War Office as
                        to training and it was left to them to develop tactics that were relevant to their own
                        locality. However, with little professional support, a man in the Home Guard was four times more
                        likely to die, in an accident in training, than a regular soldier.
                        <br><br>The Home Guard acted as sentries during the day and night and became extra 'ears and
                        eyes' for the full-time military. They checked that people were carrying their Identity Cards.
                        Those caught without one could be arrested and handed over to the police.
                        <br><br>Home Guard units would know who lived locally and any strangers to an area would be
                        subject to a check, especially as there was a genuine fear of 'Fifth Columnists'.
                        The Home Guard was also responsible for taking down road signs and any local clues that might
                        help the enemy, should they invade.
                        <br><br>Though not seen as "real soldiers", the Home Guard did valuable work. By acting as
                        sentries, patrolling the countryside etc. they releived the regular army to do other work.
                        <br><br>Winston Churchill said of the force:
                        <br><br><i>"Such a force is of the highest value and importance. A country where every streen
                            and every village bristles with resolute, armed men is a country against which the tactics
                            that destroyed the Dutch will not succeed........a country so defended would not be liable
                            to be overthrown."</i>
